        Problems: 10 points each.
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Draw a tree diagram for the situation in which:
                <br>For your first course, you can have soup or a salad.
                <br>For your second course, you can have beef, chicken, or pasta.
                <br>For your third course, you can have cake or ice cream.
                <br>What is the number of total possible dinners you can have?
                <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

            <li>For your trip home from SJC, you first can choose to get to
                Grand Army Plaza by bus, by subway, or by cab.
                <br>From there, you get either a bus or a subway.
                <br>You get out at
                your stop, and then you can either walk home or rent a
                CitiBike.
                <br>Draw a tree diagram for this situation.
                <br>What are the total number of routes home open to you?
                <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

            <li>Draw a Venn diagram for these three sets:
                <br>
                "States in New England", "States beginning with M", "States
                bordering Canada".
                <br>
                Use state abbreviations (e.g., "NY") to fill in the members of
                each set.
                <br>
                What is the intersection of the three sets?
                <br>
                (You can easily find a list of states, a map, and a list of New
                England states online.)
                <br>

                <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

            <li>We have the following set of data for ages of students in a
                class: 23, 43, 19, 19, 62, 18, 19, 27, 29, 17, 38.
                <br>
                What is the mean age? What is the median age? What is the mode?
                <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

            <li>Draw a histogram for income distribution at a company if we
                have employees making: $30,000; $32,000; $36,000; $44,000;
                $48,000; $52,000; $53,000; $57,000; $59,000; $61,000; $63,000;
                $72,000; $78,000; and $84,000.

        Multiple Choice: 5 points each.
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Imagine a multiple choice test with five questions, each with
                four answers.
                <br>
                What are the odds that two students guessing
                randomly will turn in the exact same test?
                <br>
                (By same test, I mean each answer is identical.)
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>1 in 5
                    <li>1 in 4
                    <li>1 in 1024
                    <li>1 in a million
                </ol>

            <li>If you have a fair, 12-sided die, what are the chances of rolling a
                seven?
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>1 in 7
                    <li>1 in 12
                    <li>1 in 6
                    <li>No one can say
                </ol>

            <li>Let's say the odds of someone in your building winning the
                lottery are one in a million.
                <br>
                Your neighbor wins the lottery today.
                <br>
                What are your odds of winning it tomorrow?
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>One in a trillion (1/1000000 * 1/1000000)
                    <li>Very good: your building is on a lucky streak.
                    <li>Very bad: your building won't be "due" again for a
                        while.
                    <li>One in a million
                </ol>

            <li>Your friend is usually only sick once a year.
                <br>
                She is sick today. What are the odds that she will be sick
                tomorrow?
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>1 in 365
                    <li>1 in 2
                    <li>Can't say: the events are not independent.
                    <li>1 in 7
                </ol>
                
            <li>In a spa, a person can choose Swedish or Thai massage,
                <br>
                followed by Russian sauna or Finnish sauna,
                <br>
                followed by a salt scrub or a facial or a manicure or a pedicure.
                <br>
                How many possible visit plans are there?
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>3
                    <li>8
                    <li>16
                    <li>32
                </ol>

            <li>If a distribution has a "fat tail," that means:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>A few values dominate the population.
                    <li>There is a fat chance of finding out anything about it.
                    <li>The mean, median and mode will all be the same.
                    <li>It looks like the standard bell curve.
                </ol>

            <li>When we want to know about a population but it is too big, we
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>give up.
                    <li>sample.
                    <li>guess.
                    <li>distribute.
                </ol>

            <li>Statistics that tell us about the spread of a distribution
                include:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the mean, the mode, and the median.
                    <li>probability, set theory, and expectations.
                    <li>skewness, kertosis, and gamma.
                    <li>the variance, the standard deviation, and the range.
                </ol>

            <li>If we want to create a sample to gain information about a
                population, the best way to do so is:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>put in exactly the proportion of members of the
                        population into our sample as exist in the general
                        population.
                    <li>ask for as many volunteers as possible to fill in a
                        questionnaire.
                    <li>put up a survey on the Internet and see who answers it.
                    <li>randomly pick members of the population.
                </ol>

            <li>If we have a population with some very extreme values, the best
                measure of its average is:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the mean.
                    <li>the median.
                    <li>the mode.
                    <li>the variance.
                </ol>

        </ol>
