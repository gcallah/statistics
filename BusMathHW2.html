            <li>We have the following set of data for weights of our basketball
                players: 145, 213, 174, 198, 240, 201, 188, 215, 196, 201.
                <br>
                What is the mean weight? What is the median weight? What is the mode?
                <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

            <li>Draw a histogram for the following data for student GPAs:
                <br>
                1.2, 1.8, 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 2.7, 2.9, 3.1, 3.1, 3.2, 3.2, 3.4, 
                3.6, 3.8, 3.9, 4.0
                <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

            <li>Calculate the standard deviation for the data series in
                the previous question.

        Multiple Choice: 5 points each.

        <ol>
            <li>Imagine a multiple choice test with three questions, each with
                five answers.
                <br>
                What are the odds that two students guessing
                randomly will turn in the exact same test?
                <br>
                (By same test, I mean each answer is identical.)
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>1 in 5
                    <li>1 in 25
                    <li>1 in 40
                    <li>1 in 125
                </ol>

            <li>Coney Island usually see a shark attack once every ten years.
                <br>
                We read about a shark attack on August 15. On August 16, the
                probability of a shark attack is still:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>one per every ten years.
                    <li>1 in 2
                    <li>can't say: the events are not independent.
                    <li>very low: that could never happen two days in a row.
                </ol>

            <li>If a distribution has a "fat tail," that means:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>We will need a much larger sample than with a Bell
                        Curve to really know what is going on.
                    <li>There is a fat chance of finding out anything about it.
                    <li>The mean, median and mode will all be the same.
                    <li>We can model it just like a normal distribution.
                </ol>

            <li>Our confidence in a population sample depends upon
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the honesty of people's answers.
                    <li>the sample size.
                    <li>having a truly random sample.
                    <li>all of the above.
                </ol>

            <li>Statistics that tell us about the central tendency of a distribution
                include:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the mean, the mode, and the median.
                    <li>probability, set theory, and expectations.
                    <li>skewness, kertosis, and gamma.
                    <li>the variance, the standard deviation, and the range.
                </ol>

            <li>We use random sampling because
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>it is less work that way.
                    <li>statisticians love their random number generators.
                    <li>it is too expensive to do anything else.
                    <li>it doesn't assume we <em>already</em> know about the population.
                </ol>

            <li>If we have a population with a normal distribution, the best
                measure of its average is:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the mean.
                    <li>the median.
                    <li>the mode.
                    <li>won't matter, they will be the same.
                </ol>

        </ol>
