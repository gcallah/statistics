            <li>For your trip home from SJC, you first can choose 
                by bus, by subway, or by cab to the waterfront.
                <br>From there, you get either a ferry, a subway, or swim.
                <br>When you get to Manhattan
                you can either walk home or rent a
                CitiBike.
                <br>Draw a tree diagram for this situation.
                <br>What are the total number of routes home open to you?
                <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

            <li>Draw a Venn diagram for these three sets:
                <br>
                "Countries in Asia", "Countries beginning with R", "Countries
                in Europe".
                <br>
                Once again, you don't need to be complete!
                <br>
                What is the intersection of the three sets?
                <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
                <br> <br>

            <li>We have the following set of data for ages of students in a
                class: 21, 43, 19, 19, 62, 21, 21, 27, 39, 17, 38.

                What is the mean age? What is the median age? What is the mode?

            <li>Draw a tree diagram for the situation in which:
                <br>For your first course, you can have soup, salad,
                bruschetta, or antipasto.
                <br>For your second course, you can have pasta, rice, or
                polenta.
                <br>For your third course, you can have fish, chicken, or lamb.
                <br>What is the number of total possible schedules you can have?

                "Places to get hamburgers", "Places in NYC colleges",
                "Places on Clinton Ave."

        Multiple Choice: 4 points each.
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Imagine a multiple choice test with six questions, each with
                three answers.
                <br>
                What are the chances that two students guessing
                randomly will turn in the exact same test?
                <br>
                (By same test, I mean each answer is identical.)
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>1 in 3
                    <li>1 in 9
                    <li>1 in 81
                    <li>1 in 729
                </ol>

            <li>If you have a fair, 4-sided die, what are the chances of rolling 
                two threes in a row?
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>1 in 4
                    <li>1 in 12
                    <li>1 in 16
                    <li>1 in 32
                </ol>

            <li>Let's say the odds of someone in your building winning the
                lottery are one in a million.
                <br>
                Your neighbor wins the lottery today.
                <br>
                What are your odds of winning it tomorrow?
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>One in a trillion (1/1000000 * 1/1000000)
                    <li>Very good: your building is on a lucky streak.
                    <li>Very bad: your building won't be "due" again for a
                        while.
                    <li>One in a million
                </ol>

            <li>In a spa, a person can choose Japanese, Swedish or Thai massage,
                <br>
                followed by Russian sauna or Finnish sauna or a steam bath,
                <br>
                followed by a salt scrub or a facial or a manicure or a pedicure.
                <br>
                How many possible visit plans are there?
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>9
                    <li>16
                    <li>36
                    <li>39
                </ol>

            <li>If a distribution has a "fat tail," that means:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>A few values dominate the population.
                    <li>There is a fat chance of finding out anything about it.
                    <li>The mean, median and mode will all be the same.
                    <li>It looks like the standard bell curve.
                </ol>

            <li>When we want to know about a population but it is too big, we
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>give up.
                    <li>sample.
                    <li>guess.
                    <li>distribute.
                </ol>

            <li>Statistics that tell us about the spread of a distribution
                include:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the mean, the mode, and the median.
                    <li>probability, set theory, and expectations.
                    <li>skewness, kertosis, and gamma.
                    <li>the variance, the standard deviation, and the range.
                </ol>

            <li>If we want to create a sample to gain information about a
                population, the best way to do so is:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>put in exactly the proportion of members of the
                        population into our sample as exist in the general
                        population.
                    <li>ask for as many volunteers as possible to fill in a
                        questionnaire.
                    <li>put up a survey on the Internet and see who answers it.
                    <li>randomly pick members of the population.
                </ol>

            <li>If we have a population with fat tails, the best
                measure of its average is:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the mean.
                    <li>the median.
                    <li>the mode.
                    <li>the variance.
                </ol>

            <li>What are your chances of drawing a seven of spades from a standard,
                52-card deck on your first try?
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>1 in 13
                    <li>1 in 26
                    <li>1 in 52
                    <li>1 in 104
                </ol>
                
            <li>In New York City, it typically reaches over 100 only in day in
                1000. (I made this up, but the real number is probably similar.)
                <br>
                On August 15 it is 103. On August 16, the
                probability of a day over 100 is:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>still one in a 1000.
                    <li>1 in 2000.
                    <li>can't say: the events are not independent.
                    <li>very low: that could never happen two days in a row.
                </ol>

            <li>The odds against drawing a royal flush on the first deal are
                649,739 to 1.
                <br>
                You draw one on your first hand in Vegas.
                <br>
                What are the odds against drawing one on your second hand?
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>A quintillion to 1.
                    <li>Very good: you are on a hot streak.
                    <li>Very bad: you won't be "due" again for a while.
                    <li>649,739 to 1.
                </ol>

            <li>In Tic-Tac-Toe, there are nine squares. The first player can
                choose any of the 9 to place is mark.
                <br>
                But then there are only 8 places for the second player to
                choose. And then only 7, etc.
                <br>
                How many possible positions are there after the second players
                second move?
                <ol type="a">
