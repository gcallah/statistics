        <ol>
            <li>The "law of large numbers" claims that

                <ol type="a">

                    <li>As we repeat a process, the proportion of "successes" comes closer
                    and closer to the actual probability of success.
                    <li>When numbers get too large, it is impossible to work with them.
                    <li>It is easier it is easier to work with 
                        the logarithm of a large number than the number itself.
                    <li>Past a certain large number, there are no more prime numbers.
                </ol>


<li>I'll tell you I will pay you $100 if you draw a red Queen or the two of spades from a deck of cards on your first try. What is the probability of you winning the money?

3 / 52
1 / 52
1 / 26
1 / 13 


<li>If you are willing to give 4 to 1 odds that you will pass the statistics test,
you must think your probability of success is

.80
.75
.99
.60


<li>If there are n equally likely possibilities, and s of those possibilities
are considered "success," then the probability of success is:

s / n
s * n
s + n
n - s





<li>In mathematics, a probability is a number

Greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to one.
That is usually negative.
That is always prime.
That could be as large as one wants.





	
<li>If we say that the odds of Serena Williams winning the U.S. Open
are 2 to 1 in favor, this is the same as saying the probability of her winning is:

2 / 3
2 / 1
1 / 2
3 / 2




<li>You are drawing marbles from a jar with 10 red, 14 black, 3 white, and 23 green marbles in it. What is the probability that the marble you choose is NOT green?

.54
.23
.85
.3




<li>According to the frequency interpretation of probability, the probability of an event is

The frequency with which it occurs in the long run divided 
by the total number of events of interest.
The frequency of a radio broadcast which best approximates the event.
A combination of sin and cosine functions that produces a certain frequency.
0 if the event is rare, and 1 if it is frequent.





<li>The odds of success can be defined as

the ratio of probability of success to probability of error.
the ratio of probability of error to probability of success.
very low indeed.
the ratio of probability of error to total tries.





<li>The subjective interpretation of probability books of probability as basically a question of:

what odds someone would give in making a bet on an outcome.
something that is objectively determined for all observers.
a matter of how many times an event occurs in reality.
a matter of logical necessity.




	
<li>If you feel the odds are 5 to 3 you will pass this test, what does that mean you think the probability you will pass is?

5 / 8
3 / 5
8 / 5
5 / 3




<li>Out of 20 statistics tests, Professor Callahan got tired at the end of grading and just wrote 'F' on 6 of them. If you don't know where your test was in the pile, what is the probability you got one of these Fs?

.3
.6
.20
.9




<li>Professor Callahan offers a $100 prize to a random student drawn from those who will come in on a Saturday and fill out a survey for him. He expects 150 students will show up. How much would it be worthwhille to pay to travel to SJC for a chance at this prize, so that you at least break even with your expected winnings? 

66 cents
1 cent
10 dollars
1 dollar



<li>You have a dozen eggs in your refrigerator, and three of them are rotten. If you reach in and pull out one get random, what is the probability that you have a rotten egg?

.25
.3
.12
.4





<li>You walk into a party and see you are only the second person to arrive. What are the odds the other person has the same birthday as you?

1 / 365
1 / 182
1 / 730
1 / 23



<li>If we accept only the frequency theory of probability, it is hard to explain how we can assign probabilities to

events that happen only once.
the repeated rolls of a roulette wheel.
the chances an average, healthy adult of 40 will die this year.
the amount it will rain in Arizona this year.





<li>I'm so tired, the odds are 4 to 1 against my making it through the night without falling over.

What is the probability I will fall over?

.8
.4
.75
.25






	
<li>If I claim, "There is only a 10% chance that the Jets will win this week," I ought to be willing to take a bet at

9 to 1 odds against me.
10 to 1 odds against me.
9 to 1 odds in my favor.
20 to 1 odds in my favor.

            <li>Imagine a multiple choice test with five questions, each with
                three answers.
                <br>
                What are the odds that two students guessing
                randomly will turn in the exact same test?
                <br>
                (By same test, I mean each answer is identical.)
                <ol type="a">

                    <li>1 in a million
                </ol>

            <li>If you have a fair, 20-sided die, what are the chances of rolling a
                seventeen?
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>1 in 7

                    <li>No one can say
                </ol>

            <li>Let's say you typically see one statistician per day. Suddenly,
                this morning you see one hundred.
                <br>
                What are your odds of seeing one hundred again tomorrow?
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Can't say: there might be a statistics conference on
                        campus, meaning these would not be independent events.
                    <li>Very good: you are on a lucky streak.
                    <li>Very bad: the law of large numbers says you won't see
                        another statistician for 100 days.
                    <li>One in a hundred.
                </ol>

            <li>Your friend is usually only sick once a year.
                <br>
                She is sick today. What are the odds that she will be sick
                tomorrow?

                    <li>1 in 7
                </ol>

            <li>When we are selecting items from a group and order matters,
                that is called a:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>permutation

                    <li>confrontation

            <li>When we are selecting items from a group and order does <em>not</em>
                matter, that is called a:

                    <li>permutation
                    <li>perversion

                    <li>confrontation
                </ol>

            <li>How many possible permutations are there of the word
                "Mississippi"?
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>11!

                    <li>10 choose 4
                </ol>

            <li>In a restaurant, a person can choose dumplings or egg rolls,
                <br>
                followed by egg drop or hot-and-sour soup,
                <br>
                followed by a noodles or curry or peanut chicken or orange beef.
                <br>
                How many possible meals are there?
                <ol type="a">

            <li>If a caterer has 7 items on its menu, and the customer can
                choose any 4,
                <br>
                all to be served at once, buffet style, the number of possible meals is:

            <li>I have received the following number of pieces of mail each day
                this week:
                <br>1, 6, 2, 2, 8, 1, 2
                What is the modal number of mails I received?

            <li>A tornado hits your neighborhood once every 100 years.
                <br>
                One hit five minutes ago. The probability of another today are:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>one per every 100 years.
                    <li>1 in 2
                    <li>can't say: the events are not independent.
                    <li>very low: that could never happen twice in a day.
                </ol>

            <li>If a distribution has a "fat tail," that means:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>There is a fat chance of finding out anything about it.
                    <li>The mean, median and mode will all be the same.
                    <li>We can model it just like a normal distribution.
                    <li>Single events make up a large part of the mean.
                </ol>

            <li>Our confidence in a population sample depends upon
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the honesty of people's answers.
                    <li>the sample size.
                    <li>having a truly random sample.
                    <li>all of the above.
                </ol>

            <li>Statistics that tell us about the central tendency of a distribution
                include:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the mean, the mode, and the median.
                    <li>probability, set theory, and expectations.
                    <li>skewness, kertosis, and gamma.
                    <li>the variance, the standard deviation, and the range.
                </ol>

            <li>We use random sampling because
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>it is less work that way.
                    <li>statisticians love their random number generators.
                    <li>it is too expensive to do anything else.
                    <li>it doesn't assume we <em>already</em> know about the population.
                </ol>

            <li>If we have a population with a normal distribution, the best
                measure of its average is:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the mean.
                    <li>the median.
                    <li>the mode.
                    <li>won't matter, they will be the same.
                </ol>

            <li>Statistics that tell us about the spread of a distribution
                include:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the mean, the mode, and the median.
                    <li>probability, set theory, and expectations.
                    <li>skewness, kertosis, and gamma.
                    <li>the variance, the standard deviation, and the range.
                </ol>

            <li>If we have a population with some very extreme values, the best
                measure of its average is:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the mean.
                    <li>the median.
                    <li>the mode.
                    <li>the variance.
                </ol>

            <li>The fact that larger samples usually give us a better window into the
                whole population than do smaller samples is an example of:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the law of binomial distribution.
                    <li>the law of large letters.
                    <li>the law of the jungle.
                    <li>the law of large numbers.
                </ol>

            <li>An example of a (roughly) normal distribution is:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the height of American women.
                    <li>IQ.
                    <li>the shoe size of American men.
                    <li>all of the above.
                </ol>

            <li>Something definitely NOT normally distributed is:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the height of American women.
                    <li>the annual income of Americans.
                    <li>the hat size of American men.
                    <li>all of the above.
                </ol>

            <li>Another distribution that is NOT normal is:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the height of American men.
                    <li>the weight of all animals.
                    <li>the shoe size of European women.
                    <li>all of the above.
                </ol>

            <li>A traffic cop gives out the following number of tickets for a
                ten-day period: 
                <br>
                12, 14, 6, 13, 18, 5, 8, 13, 7, 10
                <br>
                What is the median number of tickets given out?

                </ol>

            <li>For the data in the previous question, what is the mean
                <br>
                number of tickets given out?
