        Name: ______________________________________

        </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>You are spinning a roulette wheel with 36 numbers on it. You
            <br>
            keep playing 8. The probability of you hitting twice in a row is:
                <ol>
                    <li>1 / 36
                    <li>1 / 72
                    <li>1 / 1296
                    <li>1 / 3600
                </ol>

            <li>We draw a sample from a
                <ol>
                    <li>range.
                    <li>standard deviation.
                    <li>variance.
                    <li>population.
                </ol>

            <li>The "law of large numbers" claims that
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>As we repeat a process, the proportion of "successes" comes closer
                    and closer to the actual probability of success.
                    <li>When numbers get too large, it is impossible to work with them.
                    <li>It is easier it is easier to work with 
                        the logarithm of a large number than the number itself.
                    <li>Past a certain large number, there are no more prime numbers.
                </ol>


            <li>I'll tell you I will pay you $100 if you draw a queen or a two from a deck of cards on your first try.
            <br>What is the probability of you winning the money?

                <ol type="a">
                    <li>3 / 52
                    <li>1 / 52
                    <li>1 / 26
                    <li>2 / 13 
                </ol>


            <li>If you are willing to give 7 to 1 odds that you will pass the statistics test,
            <br>you must think your probability of success is
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>.875
                    <li>.75
                    <li>.999
                    <li>.6666
                </ol>

            <li>The standard deviation will always be less than 
                <ol>
                    <li>the variance.
                    <li>the range.
                    <li>the skew.
                    <li>the mode.
                </ol>


            <li>If there are n equally likely possibilities,
            <br>and s of those possibilities are considered "success,"
            then the probability of success is:
                <ol type="a">

                    <li>s / n
                    <li>s * n
                    <li>s + n
                    <li>n - s
                </ol>


            <li>In mathematics, a probability is a number
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to one.
                    <li>That is usually negative.
                    <li>That is always prime.
                    <li>That could be as large as one wants.
                </ol>

	
            <li>If we say that the odds of Serena Williams winning the U.S. Open are 3 to 2 in
            <br> favor, this is the same as saying the probability of her winning is:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>2 / 3
                    <li>3 / 5
                    <li>5 / 3
                    <li>3 / 2
                </ol>


            <li>You are drawing marbles from a jar with 10 red, 14 black, 8
            white, and 18 green marbles in it.
            <br>
            What is the probability that the marble you choose is NOT green?
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>.54
                    <li>.23
                    <li>.64
                    <li>.3
                </ol>


            <li>According to the frequency interpretation of probability, the probability of an event is
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>The frequency with which it occurs in the long run divided 
                        by the total number of events of interest.
                    <li>The frequency of a radio broadcast which best approximates the event.
                    <li>A combination of sin and cosine functions that produces a certain frequency.
                    <li>0 if the event is rare, and 1 if it is frequent.
                </ol>


            <li>The odds of success can be defined as

                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the ratio of probability of success to probability of error.
                    <li>the ratio of probability of error to probability of success.
                    <li>very low indeed.
                    <li>the ratio of probability of error to total tries.
                </ol>


            <li>The subjective interpretation of probability books of probability as basically a question of:

                <ol type="a">
                    <li>what odds someone would give in making a bet on an outcome.
                    <li>something that is objectively determined for all observers.
                    <li>a matter of how many times an event occurs in reality.
                    <li>a matter of logical necessity.
                </ol>

	
            <li>If you feel the odds are 5 to 3 you will pass this test, what does that mean you think the probability you will pass is?

                <ol type="a">
                    <li>5 / 8
                    <li>3 / 5
                    <li>8 / 5
                    <li>5 / 3
                </ol>


            <li>Out of 25 statistics tests, Professor Callahan got tired at the end of grading and just wrote 'F' on 6 of them.
            <br>If you don't know where your test was in the pile, what is the probability you got one of these Fs?

                <ol type="a">
                    <li>.33
                    <li>.6
                    <li>.24
                    <li>.9
                </ol>


            <li>Professor Callahan offers a $100 prize to a random student drawn 
            <br>from those who will come in on a Saturday and fill out a survey for him.
            <br>He expects 150 students will show up.
            <br>How much would it be worthwhille to pay to travel to SJC for a chance at this prize, so that you at least break even with your expected winnings? 

                <ol type="a">
                    <li>66 cents
                    <li>1 cent
                    <li>10 dollars
                    <li>1 dollar
                </ol>


            <li>You have a dozen eggs in your refrigerator, and four of them are rotten.
            <br>
            If you reach in and pull out one get random, what is the probability that you have a rotten egg?

                <ol type="a">
                    <li>.25
                    <li>.33
                    <li>.12
                    <li>.4
                </ol>


            <li>You walk into a party and see you are only the second person to arrive.
            <br>
            What are the odds the other person's last name starts with the same
            letter as yours?

                <ol type="a">
                    <li>1 / 365
                    <li>1 / 26
                    <li>1 / 10
                    <li>1 / 2
                </ol>


            <li>If we accept only the frequency theory of probability, it is hard to explain how we can assign probabilities to

                <ol type="a">
                    <li>events that happen only once.
                    <li>the repeated rolls of a roulette wheel.
                    <li>the chances an average, healthy adult of 40 will die this year.
                    <li>the amount it will rain in Arizona this year.
                </ol>


            <li>I'm so tired, the odds are 4 to 1 against my making it
            <br>through the night without falling over.
            <br>What is the probability I will fall over?

                <ol type="a">
                    <li>.8
                    <li>.4
                    <li>.75
                    <li>.25
                </ol>

	
            <li>If I claim, "There is only a 20% chance that the Jets will win this week,"
            <br>I ought to be willing to make a bet against the Jets at

                <ol type="a">
                    <li>4 to 1 odds against me.
                    <li>5 to 1 odds against me.
                    <li>4 to 1 odds in my favor.
                    <li>20 to 1 odds against me.
                </ol>


            <li>Consider the following test scores:
            <br>54, 66, 72, 73, 77, 80, 81, 84, 90, 96.
            <br>A reasonable guess as to the standard deviation of these
            numbers would be:
                <ol>
                    <li>2
                    <li>10
                    <li>100
                    <li>1000
                </ol>

            <li>Imagine a multiple choice test with five questions, each with
                three answers.
                <br>
                What are the odds that two students guessing
                randomly will turn in the exact same test?
                <br>
                (By same test, I mean each answer is identical.)
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>1 in 5
                    <li>1 in 25
                    <li>1 in 125
                    <li>1 in a million
                </ol>

            <li>If you have a fair, 20-sided die, what are the chances of rolling a
                seventeen?
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>1 in 7
                    <li>1 in 12
                    <li>1 in 20
                    <li>No one can say
                </ol>

            <li>Let's say you typically see one statistician per day.
            <br>Suddenly, this morning you see one hundred.
                <br>
                What are your odds of seeing one hundred again tomorrow?
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Can't say: there might be a statistics conference on
                        campus, meaning these would not be independent events.
                    <li>Very good: you are on a lucky streak.
                    <li>Very bad: the law of large numbers says you won't see
                        another statistician for 100 days.
                    <li>One in a hundred.
                </ol>

            <li>Your friend is usually only sick once a year.
                <br>
                She is sick today. What are the odds that she will be sick
                tomorrow?
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>1 in 365
                    <li>1 in 2

                    <li>1 in 7
                </ol>

            <li>When we are selecting items from a group and order matters,
                that is called a:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>permutation
                    <li>perversion

                    <li>confrontation
                </ol>

            <li>When we are selecting items from a group and order does <em>not</em>
                matter, that is called a:
                <ol type="a">

                    <li>confrontation
                </ol>

            <li>How many possible permutations are there of the word
                "Mississippi"?
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>11!
                    <li>10! / (4 * 4 * 2)
                    <li>10! / (4! * 4! * 2!)
                    <li>10 choose 4
                </ol>

            <li>In a restaurant, a person can choose dumplings or egg rolls,
                <br>
                followed by egg drop or hot-and-sour soup,
                <br>
                followed by a noodles or curry or peanut chicken or orange beef.
                <br>
                How many possible meals are there?
                <ol type="a">

            <li>If a caterer has 7 items on its menu, and the customer can
                choose any 4,
                <br>
                all to be served at once, buffet style, the number of possible meals is:

                    <li>7200
                </ol>

        
            <li>I have received the following number of pieces of mail each day
                this week:
                <br>1, 6, 2, 2, 8, 1, 2
                What is the modal number of mails I received?
                <br>
                <ol type="a">

                    <li>3.66
                </ol>

            <li>A tornado hits your neighborhood once every 100 years.
                <br>
                One hit five minutes ago. The probability of another today are:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>one per every 100 years.
                    <li>1 in 2
                    <li>can't say: the events are not independent.
                    <li>very low: that could never happen twice in a day.

            <li>If a distribution has a "fat tail," that means:

                    <li>There is a fat chance of finding out anything about it.
                    <li>The mean, median and mode will all be the same.
                    <li>We can model it just like a normal distribution.
                    <li>Single events make up a large part of the mean.
                </ol>

            <li>Our confidence in a population sample depends upon
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the honesty of people's answers.
                    <li>the sample size.
                    <li>having a truly random sample.
                    <li>all of the above.
                </ol>

            <li>Statistics that tell us about the central tendency of a distribution
                include:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the mean, the mode, and the median.
                    <li>probability, set theory, and expectations.
                    <li>skewness, kertosis, and gamma.
                    <li>the variance, the standard deviation, and the range.
                </ol>

            <li>We use random sampling because
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>it is less work that way.
                    <li>statisticians love their random number generators.
                    <li>it is too expensive to do anything else.
                    <li>it doesn't assume we <em>already</em> know about the population.
                </ol>

            <li>If we have a population with a normal distribution, the best
                measure of its average is:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the mean.
                    <li>the median.
                    <li>the mode.
                    <li>won't matter, they will be the same.
                </ol>

            <li>Statistics that tell us about the spread of a distribution
                include:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the mean, the mode, and the median.
                    <li>probability, set theory, and expectations.
                    <li>skewness, kertosis, and gamma.
                    <li>the variance, the standard deviation, and the range.
                </ol>

            <li>If we have a population with some very extreme values, the best
                measure of its average is:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the mean.
                    <li>the median.
                    <li>the mode.
                    <li>the variance.
                </ol>

            <li>The fact that larger samples usually give us a better window into the
                whole population than do smaller samples is an example of:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the law of binomial distribution.
                    <li>the law of large letters.
                    <li>the law of the jungle.
                    <li>the law of large numbers.
                </ol>

            <li>An example of a (roughly) normal distribution is:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the height of American women.
                    <li>IQ.
                    <li>the shoe size of American men.
                    <li>all of the above.
                </ol>

            <li>Something definitely NOT normally distributed is:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the height of American women.
                    <li>the annual income of Americans.
                    <li>the hat size of American men.
                    <li>all of the above.
                </ol>

            <li>Another distribution that is NOT normal is:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the height of American men.
                    <li>the weight of all animals.
                    <li>the shoe size of European women.
                    <li>all of the above.
                </ol>

            <li>A traffic cop gives out the following number of tickets for a
