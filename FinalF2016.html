            <li>Imagine a multiple choice test with five questions, each with
                three answers.
                <br>
                What are the odds that two students guessing
                randomly will turn in the exact same test?
                <br>
                (By same test, I mean each answer is identical.)
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>1 in 5
                    <li>1 in 25

                    <li>1 in a million
                </ol>

            <li>If you have a fair, 20-sided die, what are the chances of rolling a
                seventeen?
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>1 in 7

                    <li>No one can say
                </ol>

            <li>Let's say the odds of someone in your building winning the
                lottery are one in a million.
                <br>
                Your neighbor wins the lottery today.
                <br>
                What are your odds of winning it tomorrow?
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>One in a trillion (1/1000000 * 1/1000000)
                    <li>Very good: your building is on a lucky streak.
                    <li>Very bad: your building won't be "due" again for a
                        while.
                    <li>One in a million
                </ol>
            <li>Your friend is usually only sick once a year.
                <br>
                She is sick today. What are the odds that she will be sick
                tomorrow?
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>1 in 365

            <li>When we are selecting items from a group and order matters,
                that is called a:

            <li>When we are selecting items from a group and order does <em>not</em>
                matter, that is called a:

                    <li>confrontation
                </ol>

            <li>How many possible permutations are there of the word
                "statistics"?
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>10!
                    <li>10! / (3 * 3 * 2)
                    <li>10! / (3! * 3! * 2!)
                    <li>10 choose 3
                </ol>

            <li>In a spa, a person can choose Swedish or Thai massage,
                <br>
                followed by Russian sauna or Finnish sauna,
                <br>
                followed by a salt scrub or a facial or a manicure or a pedicure.
                <br>
                How many possible visit plans are there?
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>3

                    <li>32
                </ol>

            <li>If a caterer has 6 items on its menu, and the customer can
                choose any 3,
                <br>
                all to be served at once, buffet style, the number of possible meals is:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>18
                    <li>20

                    <li>7200
                </ol>

        
            <li>I have received the following number of pieces of mail each day
                this week:
                <br>1, 6, 2, 2, 8, 1, 2
                What is the modal number of mails I received?
                <br>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>1
                    <li>2
                    <li>6
                    <li>3.66
                </ol>

            <li>A tornado hits your neighborhood once every 100 years.
                <br>
                One hit five minutes ago. The probability of another today are:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>one per every 100 years.
                    <li>1 in 2
                    <li>can't say: the events are not independent.
                    <li>very low: that could never happen twice in a day.
                </ol>

            <li>If a distribution has a "fat tail," that means:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>There is a fat chance of finding out anything about it.
                    <li>The mean, median and mode will all be the same.
                    <li>We can model it just like a normal distribution.
                    <li>Single events make up a large part of the mean.
                </ol>

            <li>Our confidence in a population sample depends upon
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the honesty of people's answers.
                    <li>the sample size.
                    <li>having a truly random sample.
                    <li>all of the above.
                </ol>

            <li>Statistics that tell us about the central tendency of a distribution
                include:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the mean, the mode, and the median.
                    <li>probability, set theory, and expectations.
                    <li>skewness, kertosis, and gamma.
                    <li>the variance, the standard deviation, and the range.
                </ol>

            <li>We use random sampling because
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>it is less work that way.
                    <li>statisticians love their random number generators.
                    <li>it is too expensive to do anything else.
                    <li>it doesn't assume we <em>already</em> know about the population.
                </ol>

            <li>If we have a population with a normal distribution, the best
                measure of its average is:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the mean.
                    <li>the median.
                    <li>the mode.
                    <li>won't matter, they will be the same.
                </ol>

            <li>Statistics that tell us about the spread of a distribution
                include:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the mean, the mode, and the median.
                    <li>probability, set theory, and expectations.
                    <li>skewness, kertosis, and gamma.
                    <li>the variance, the standard deviation, and the range.
                </ol>

            <li>If we have a population with some very extreme values, the best
                measure of its average is:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the mean.
                    <li>the median.
                    <li>the mode.
                    <li>the variance.
                </ol>

            <li>The fact that larger samples usually give us a better window into the
                whole population than do smaller samples is an example of:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the law of binomial distribution.
                    <li>the law of large letters.
                    <li>the law of the jungle.
                    <li>the law of large numbers.
                </ol>

            <li>An example of a (roughly) normal distribution is:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the height of American women.
                    <li>IQ.
                    <li>the shoe size of American men.
                    <li>all of the above.
                </ol>

            <li>Something definitely NOT normally distributed is:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the height of American women.
                    <li>the annual income of Americans.
                    <li>IQ.
                    <li>all of the above.
                </ol>

            <li>Another distribution that is NOT normal is:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the height of American men.
                    <li>the weight of animals.
                    <li>the shoe size of European women.
                    <li>all of the above.
                </ol>
        </ol>
