            Introduction

            <p>
                Some concepts from Chapter 6 we need.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Independent variable</b>
                    <br />
                    Manipulated by the experimenter
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Dependent variable</b>
                    <br />
                    Not manipulated by the experimenter
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Null hypothesis</b>
                    <br />
                    Nothing is going on!
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Alternative hypothesis</b>
                    <br />
                    Something's happening here!
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>alpha</b>
                    <br />
                    If the null hypothesis is true, how likely is our result?
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Type I error</b>
                    <br />
                    We reject the null hypothesis, although it is true.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Type II error</b>
                    <br />
                    We accept the null hypothesis, although it is false.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Crucial point: if we decrease the chance of a type I error,
                    we increase the chance of type II, and vice versa.
                </li>
            </ul>

                Another thing to discuss: what is the height of the average
                animal?
                <br />
                Number of insects is estimated to be roughly
                1,000,000,000,000,000,000. By comparison, the number of humans
                is 7,000,000,000.
                <br />
                What is the mean weight of all animals going to be?
                <br />
                What is the mean weight of all humans?
                <br />
                Do we expect to see a human 1000 times the mean weight? Do we
                expect to see an animal 1000 times the mean weight?
            </p>

                The professor gets you to gamble with him, betting on tosses of
                his "fair" coin. He takes heads, and the first ten tosses come
                up heads seven times.
                <br />
                Should you accuse him of cheating?

            <p>
                The &chi;<sup>2</sup> test typically uses the &alpha; = .05
                cutoff for determining the <b>critical region</b> or the
                <b>area of rejection</b>.
                <br />
                If the &chi;<sup>2</sup> value is greater than the value in our
                table, we <i>reject</i> the null hypothesis.

                Very important: <i>significant</i> means something very
                specific in statistics: it just means the result is in the
                (arbitrarily chosen) <i>critical region</i>.

            <p>
                Important concept: <i>degrees of freedom</i> (<i>df</i>).
                <br />
                A toss of a die has <b>5</b> degrees of freedom: once you know
                the die was <b>not</b> 1 - 5, you know it was 6.
                <br />
                With more degrees of freedom, we expect more difference from
                the expected value.
            </p>

            <p>
                <i>H</i><sub>0</sub>: we have fair dice.
                <br />
                <i>H</i><sub>1</sub>: we don't have fair dice.
            </p>

            <p>
                We toss the die 100 times, and get 20 ones, 14 twos, 15 threes,
                18 fours, 12 fives, and 21 sixes.

                <li>
                    The test compares observed and expected frequencies. This
                    means we must <i>already know</i> an expected frequency!
                </li>
                <li>
                    The test just says whether <i>something</i> unexpected
                    occurred. We must examine the data to see what that was,
                    e.g., too many sixes in our dice rolling.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The test does not incorporate any measure of
                    <i>effect size</i>, a topic taken up later in our textbook.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Expected frequencies must be at least five for the test to
                    apply. (We can see why if we contemplate tossing a coin a
                    single time and trying to apply a &chi;<sup>2</sup> test to
                    the result!)
