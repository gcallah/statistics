                    "Statistics investigates and develops specific methods for
                    evaluating hypotheses in the light of empirical facts. A
                    method is called statistical, and thus the subject of study
                    in statistics, if it relates facts and hypotheses of a
                    particular kind: the empirical facts must be codified and
                    structured into data sets, and the hypotheses must be
                    formulated in terms of probability distributions over
                    possible data sets." --

                    Inferential statistics allows us to move from observed data
                    to reach conclusions about data we haven't observed. That

                    might be past data we can't get at.

                    <b>An example of the latter</b>: What was the composition
                    of the legions in the late Roman Empire? We only have
                    <b>samples</b> of this data, not all of it.
                    Inferential statistics
                    helps us determine what we can justifiably conclude from
                    the sample.
