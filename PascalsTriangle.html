        <ul>
            <li>How many ways can 0 switches be set?
                <br>Question may seem weird, but mathematicians want to be
                thorough!
                <br>We could say 0 or 1, but 1 works better!
                <br>So zero switches have one state.
            <li>How many ways can 1 switch be set on?
                <br>One, it is on!
            <li>How many ways can 1 switch be set off?
                <br>One, it is off!
            <li>How many ways can 2 switches be set all on?
                <br>One, they are all on!
            <li>How many ways can 2 switches be set all off?
                <br>One, they are all off!
            <li>How many ways can 2 switches be set one on, one off?
                <br>Two ways, switch one is on switch, two is off,
                or switch one is off, switch two is on.
            <li>How many ways can 3 switches be set all on?
                <br>One, they are all on!
            <li>How many ways can 3 switches be set all off?
                <br>One, they are all off!
            <li>How many ways can 3 switches have 1 switch on (= 2 off)?
                <br>3 ways: switch 1 is on, switch 2 is on, or switch 3 is on.
            <li>How many ways can 3 switches have 2 switches on (= 1 off)?
                <br>3 ways: switch 1 is off, switch 2 is off, or switch 3 is
                off.
