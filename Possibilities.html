            <b>Example:</b> We posit that two teams are evenly matched, but
            one happens to be up, 3-2, in a seven game series. What are the
            odds the team that is up will win?
            <br />
            Tree diagram:
            <br />

            <img src="graphics/CavsWarriors.png" height="240" width="400">
            <br />
            <br />
            So, if each branch is equally likely:
            <br />
            Half the time, the Warriors win game 6, and the series is over.
            <br />
            The other half the time, the Cavs win game 6. Then, half the time,
            the Warriors win game 7, and half the time the Cavs win game 7.
            One half of one half is one quarter... so 25% of the time the Cavs
            win the series.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Example:</b>You have gone out for dinner, and have various
            after-dinner options (my graphic should say "dessert," not
            "desert"):
            <br />
            <br />
            <img src="graphics/AfterDinner.png" height="240" width="440">
            <br />
            <br />
            So how many possible ways can we eat dessert? Three choices for the
            sweet, and two for the beverage. 2 * 3 = 6.
            <br />
            If we were the sort of person who chose our meal randomly, there
            would be a 1/6 probability of getting any one of those
            combinations.
