                    <li>Someone taking an English exam about one of 20 novels
                        chooses which ones to study. If she chooses two, what is
                        the probability she has picked correctly?

                        (Here we are assuming each novel is equally likely to
                        be picked by the examiners.)

                    The classical interpretation of probability deals with events
                    that are equally likely. We count the number of possible
                    outcomes, which we will call <em>n</em>, and then say that the
                    likelihood of event <em>e</em> occurring is <em>1/n</em>.
                    <br>

                    Probability Rules
                </h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>If there are <em>n</em> equally likely possibilities,
                        of which one must occur and <em>s</em> are regarded as
                        favorable, then the probability of success is
                        <em>s/n</em>.
                        <br><b>Example:</b> My team plays well in bad weather,
                        and will likely wind if the weather is bad. It plays
                        tomorrow, and tomorrow there are equally likely chances
                        of a rainy day, a snowy day, or a nice, sunny day. Two
                        of those events represent "success," so the probability of my
                        team winning is 2/3.
                    <li>If there are <em>n</em> equally likely
                        possibilities, which one must occur, then each
                        possibility has the probability 1/n.

                <h3>
                    Using these rules
                </h3>
                <p>
                    What are the of drawing two red cards in a row
                    from a normal deck of cards?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Let's use our knowledge from the previous material. The
                    total number of possibilities is 52 <em>choose</em> 2,
                    while the number of favorable possiblities is 26
                    <em>choose</em> 2. So the odds are 25 / 102.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Why is it not just 1/2 * 1/2? Because once we have drawn
                    are red card, there are now fewer red cards in the deck!
                    <br>
                    Compare to coin flips.

                    Odds and probabilities:

                <p>
                    If the probability of rolling two sixes in a row is 1/36,
                    then the odds for succes are the number of outcomes that
                    result in success (1) versus the number that result in
                    failure (35). Typically, here we would say, "The odds are
                    35 to 1 against him."

                <p>
                The basic idea here is that the probability of some event
                <em>e</em> is equivalent to the number of times we would expect to
                see <em>e</em> if we repeatedly ran some process that sometimes
                produces <em>e</em>.
                <br>
                If we repeatedly flip a fair coin, in the long run, we expect
                to see a roughly equal number of heads and tails.
                <br>
                This is related to, but not the same as,
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers">
                The Law of Large Numbers.
                </a>
                The frequentist interpretation says that the probability of
                some event simply <em>is</em> its rate of occurence in the long
                run, while the Law of Large Numbers relies on there being
                something else that is the true probability, and that as our
                sample gets larger, we move towards that true probability.

                    "When something happens just once, the frequency

                    of similar situations." -- Freund, p. 50
