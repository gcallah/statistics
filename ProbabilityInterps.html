                <li>Someone taking an English exam about one of 20 novels
                    chooses which ones to study. If she chooses two, what is
                    the probability she has picked correctly?
                <li>Someone says, "Well, I don't need to rush to get my
                    husband: the train is late 80% of the time."
                <li>A businessperson says "The odds are 2-1 I will make a
                    profit this year." What does that mean?

            <p>
                The classical interpretation of probability deals with events
                that are equally likely. We count the number of possible
                outcomes, which we will call <em>n</em>, and then say that the
                likelihood of event <em>i</em> is <em>1/n</em>.

            <p>
            The basic idea here is that the probability of some event
            <em>e</em> is equilavent to the number of times we would expect to
            see <em>e</em> if we repeatedly ran some process that randomly
            might produce <em>e</em>.

            "many of the probailities which we use to express our faith in
            predictions, judgments, or decisions, are simply <em>'success
            ratios' that apply to the method we have employed</em>. -- Freund,
