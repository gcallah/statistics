                        chooses which ones to study. If she chooses two, what is

                    The classical interpretation of probability deals with events
                    that are equally likely. We count the number of possible
                    outcomes, which we will call <em>n</em>, and then say that the
                    likelihood of event <em>e</em> occurring is <em>1/n</em>.

                    <b>Odds and probabilities:</b>
                    If the probability of rolling two sixes in a row is 1/36,
                    then the odds for succes are the number of outcomes that
                    result in success (1) versus the number that result in
                    failure (35). Typically, here we would say, "The odds are
                    35 to 1 against him."

                The basic idea here is that the probability of some event
                <em>e</em> is equivalent to the number of times we would expect to
                see <em>e</em> if we repeatedly ran some process that sometimes
                produces <em>e</em>.
                <br>
                If we repeatedly flip a fair coin, in the long run, we expect
                to see a roughly equal number of heads and tails.

                This is related to, but not the same as,
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers">
                The Law of Large Numbers.
                </a>
                The frequentist interpretation says that the probability of
                some event simply <em>is</em> its rate of occurence in the long
                run, while the Law of Large Numbers relies on their being
                something else that is the true probability, and that as our
                sample gets larger, we move towards that true probability.

            <p>
                Axiomatic probability is not an interpretation of probability
                at all: it deliberately ignores the matter of interpretation
                and simply tries to set probability theory on a sound axiomatic
                basis.

                "many of the probailities which we use to express our faith in
                predictions, judgments, or decisions, are simply <em>'success
                ratios' that apply to the method we have employed</em>. -- Freund,
