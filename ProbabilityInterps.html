                The classical interpretation of probability deals with events
                that are equally likely. We count the number of possible
                outcomes, which we will call <em>n</em>, and then say that the
                likelihood of event <em>i</em> is <em>1/n</em>.

            The basic idea here is that the probability of some event
            <em>e</em> is equilavent to the number of times we would expect to
            see <em>e</em> if we repeatedly ran some process that randomly
            might produce <em>e</em>.
