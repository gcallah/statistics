            <li>Draw a tree diagram for the situation in which:
                <br>For your first course, you can have soup or a salad.
                <br>For your second course, you can have beef, chicken, or pasta.
                <br>For your third course, you can have cake or ice cream.
                <br>What is the number of total possible dinners you can have?
                <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

            <li>You are choosing 4 class representatives from a class of 12
                people.
                <br>Show how to set up this problem using the first equation on
                pg. 23.
                <br>What are the total possible combinations of four reps?
                <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

            <li>You want to establish a code to pass notes to your friends in
                class and mention other people. You decide to use permutations
                of their names, so that you can write "Joe" as "Oje."
                One of your classmates is called Lucy, but also Lulu.
                Show the possible combinations for each name. Do all
                combinations, treating each letter as unique, then cross out any
                duplicates, showing why "Lucy" gives us more combinations.

        Multiple Choice: 5 points each.

        <ol>
            <li>Imagine a multiple choice test with five questions, each with
                four answers. What are the odds that two students guessing
                randomly will turn in the exact same test? (By same task, I
                mean each answer is identical.)
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>1 in 5

            <li>Let's say the odds of someone in your building winning the
                lottery are one in a million. Your neighbor wins the

                    <li>Very bad: your building won't be "due" again for a
                        while.
