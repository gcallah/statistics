        Problems: 10 points each.

        <ol>
            <li>Draw a tree diagram for the situation in which:
                <br>For your first course, you can have soup or a salad.
                <br>For your second course, you can have beef, chicken, or pasta.
                <br>For your third course, you can have cake or ice cream.
                <br>What is the number of total possible dinners you can have?
                <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

            <li>You are choosing 4 class representatives from a class of 12
                people.
                <br>Show how to set up this problem using the first equation on
                pg. 23.
                <br>What are the total possible combinations of four reps?
                <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

            <li>You want to establish a code to pass notes to your friends in
                class and mention other people.
                <br>
                You decide to use permutations
                of their names, so that you can write "Joe" as "Oje."
                <br>
                One of your classmates is called Lucy, but also Lulu.
                <br>
                Show the possible combinations for each name.
                <br>Do all
                combinations, treating each letter as unique,
                <br>
                then cross out any duplicates, showing why "Lucy"
                gives us more combinations.
                <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

            <li>There are 8 applicants for the job of cashier at your
                supermarket. You have 5 cashier positions open.
                <br>Show how to set up this problem using the second equation on
                pg. 23.
                <br>What are the total possible combinations of 5 cashiers?
                <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

            <li>For your trip home from SJC, you first can choose to get to
                Grand Army Plaza by bus, by subway, or by cab.
                <br>From there, you
                walk two blocks to get either a bus or a subway.
                <br>You get out at
                your stop, and then you can either walk home or rent a
                CitiBike.
                <br>Draw a tree diagram for this situation.
                <br>What are the total number of routes home open to you?

                four answers.
                <br>
                What are the odds that two students guessing
                randomly will turn in the exact same test?
                <br>
                (By same test, I mean each answer is identical.)

                Your neighbor wins the lottery today.
