        <ol>
            <li>We have the following set of data for rebounds grabbed last
                game by our basketball players:
                2, 9, 13, 0, 4, 2, 6, 2, 1
                <br>
                What is the mean weight? What is the median weight? What is the mode?
                <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

            <li>Draw a histogram for the following data, which are number of
                heads flipped in ten tries:
                <br>
                2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 9
                <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

            <li>Calculate the standard deviation for the data series in
                the previous question.
                <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

            <li>Calculate the mean, median and mode for the coin flips.
                <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

            <li>We have the following set of data for ages of students in a
                class: 26, 41, 18, 19, 64, 18, 19, 27, 29, 18, 36.
                <br>
                What is the mean age? What is the median age? What is the mode?
                <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

            <li>Draw a histogram for the temperature of a two-week period in
                NYC:
                23, 25, 33, 29, 37, 42, 44, 38, 32, 24, 19, 16, 21, 25

        Multiple Choice: 5 points each.
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Imagine a multiple choice test with three questions, each with
                five answers.
                <br>
                What are the odds that two students guessing
                randomly will turn in the exact same test?
                <br>
                (By same test, I mean each answer is identical.)
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>1 in 5
                    <li>1 in 25
                    <li>1 in 40
                    <li>1 in 125
                </ol>

            <li>A tornado hits your neighborhood once every 100 years.
                <br>
                One hit five minutes ago. The probability of another today are:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>one per every 100 years.
                    <li>1 in 2
                    <li>can't say: the events are not independent.
                    <li>very low: that could never happen twice in a day.
                </ol>

            <li>If a distribution has a "fat tail," that means:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>There is a fat chance of finding out anything about it.
                    <li>The mean, median and mode will all be the same.
                    <li>We can model it just like a normal distribution.
                    <li>Single events make up a large part of the mean.
                </ol>

            <li>Our confidence in a population sample depends upon
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the honesty of people's answers.
                    <li>the sample size.
                    <li>having a truly random sample.
                    <li>all of the above.
                </ol>

            <li>Statistics that tell us about the central tendency of a distribution
                include:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the mean, the mode, and the median.
                    <li>probability, set theory, and expectations.
                    <li>skewness, kertosis, and gamma.
                    <li>the variance, the standard deviation, and the range.
                </ol>

            <li>We use random sampling because
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>it is less work that way.
                    <li>statisticians love their random number generators.
                    <li>it is too expensive to do anything else.
                    <li>it doesn't assume we <em>already</em> know about the population.
                </ol>

            <li>If we have a population with a normal distribution, the best
                measure of its average is:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the mean.
                    <li>the median.
                    <li>the mode.
                    <li>won't matter, they will be the same.
                </ol>

            <li>Statistics that tell us about the spread of a distribution
                include:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the mean, the mode, and the median.
                    <li>probability, set theory, and expectations.
                    <li>skewness, kertosis, and gamma.
                    <li>the variance, the standard deviation, and the range.
                </ol>

            <li>If we have a population with some very extreme values, the best
                measure of its average is:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the mean.
                    <li>the median.
                    <li>the mode.
                    <li>the variance.
                </ol>

            <li>The fact that larger samples usually give us a better window into the
                whole population than do smaller samples is an example of:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the law of binomial distribution.
                    <li>the law of large letters.
                    <li>the law of the jungle.
                    <li>the law of large numbers.
                </ol>

            <li>An example of a (roughly) normal distribution is:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the height of American women.
                    <li>IQ.
                    <li>the shoe size of American men.
                    <li>all of the above.
                </ol>

            <li>Something definitely NOT normally distributed is:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the height of American women.
                    <li>IQ.
                    <li>the networth of the American family.
                    <li>all of the above.
                </ol>

            <li>Another distribution that is NOT normal is:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the height of American men.
                    <li>the weight of African mammals.
                    <li>the shoe size of American women.
                    <li>all of the above.
                </ol>
        </ol>
