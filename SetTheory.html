                What Is a Set?

                Informally, a set is a collection of objects. Often, these are
                mathematical objects, but they need not be. The
                <a href="https://gcallah.github.io/statistics/Sampling.html">
                    populations
                </a>
                studied in statistics can be regarded as sets.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Examples</b>:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All bachelors over 30
                    <li>The odd integers
                    <li>The mammals of North America
                    <li>Automobiles produced in Japan
                    <li>The prime numbers
                    <li>The integers 4, 5, and 17
                        <br>(This last illustrates that sets need not be some
                        natural classification: we can put anything we want in
                        a set.)

                    <p>
                        We can define a set by listing its members. The
                        notation is: 
                        <br>
                        A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
                        <br>
                        This might be the set of possible rolls of a six-sided
                        die.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Or we can use a rule based definition. If we want all
                        even integers, we could write:
                        <br>
                        A = {x: x is even}
                    </p>

                        <br>
                        Let us define A as "the set of all states in the U.S." 
                        <br>
                        Then we might define two more sets as R = "the set of
                        states that voted for Romney in 2012," and O = "the set
                        of all states that voted for Obama in 2012."
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        Then R and O are both <em>subsets</em> of A. We define
                        a subset of a set A as any set that contains <em>only</em>
                        members A.
                        <br>
                        Our notation here is:
                        <br>
                        R &sube; A
                        <br>
                        O &sube; A
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Note that under this definition, A is a subset of
                        itself. We also can define <em>proper</em> subsets of A:
                        these contain only members of A but not <em>all</em> members
                        of A. Both R and O are also proper subsets of A. Our
                        notation is:
                        <br>
                        R &sub; A

                        we can write A = B. (Order does not matter!)

                    We can define the <em>universe</em> of some group of sets

                    These diagrams are a great way to get a picture of the ideas of

                    "The people authorized to be on our campus
                    who are not <em>either</em> students
                    at St. Joseph's College <em>or</em> faculty at St. Joseph's
                    College" (a union of two sets) is equivalent to "The people 
                    authorized to be on our campus who are not on the list of
                    students <em>and</em> who are not on the list of faculty" (an
                    intersection of two sets). This set would include
                    administrators, workers at the cafeteria, visitors with passes,
                    security personnel, and so on.

                    <br>
                    <b>Law 2</b>: what is not in the intersection of two sets is
                    the union of what is not in one of them and
                    what is not in the other of them.
                    <br>
                    <b>Example:</b>
                    U (our universe) = "people authorized to be on our campus"
                    <br>
                    "The people authorized to be on our campus
                    who are not <em>both</em> students
                    at St. Joseph's College <em>and</em> faculty at St. Joseph's
                    College" (an intersection of two sets) is equivalent to "The people 
                    authorized to be on our campus who 
                    are not students <em>or</em> who are
                    not faculty" (a union of two sets). This set contains everyone
                    authorized on campus who is not a 
                    student <em>and</em> a faculty member.
                    (Last semester, that set might have excluded only me!)
