                What Is a Set?

                Informally, a set is a collection of objects. Often, these are
                mathematical objects, but they need not be. The
                <a

                    populations</a>
                studied in statistics can be regarded as sets.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Examples</b>:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All bachelors over 30
                    <li>The odd integers
                    <li>The mammals of North America
                    <li>Automobiles produced in Japan
                    <li>The prime numbers
                    <li>The integers 4, 5, and 17
                        <br>(This last illustrates that sets need not be some
                        natural classification: we can put anything we want in
                        a set.)
                </ul>

                <h3>
                    Set membership
                </h3>
                    <p>
                        We can define a set by listing its members. The
                        notation is: 
                        <br>
                        A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
                        <br>
                        This might be the set of possible rolls of a six-sided
                        die.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Or we can use a rule based definition. If we want all
                        even integers, we could write:
                        <br>
                        A = {x: x is even}
                    </p>

                    Subsets 
                </h3>

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Let us define A as "the set of all states in the U.S." 
                        <br>
                        Then we might define two more sets as R = "the set of
                        states that voted for Romney in 2012," and O = "the set
                        of all states that voted for Obama in 2012."
                        <br>

                        <img

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Then R and O are both <em>subsets</em> of A. We define
                        a subset of a set A as any set that contains <em>only</em>
                        members A.
                        <br>
                        Our notation here is:
                        <br>
                        R &sube; A
                        <br>
                        O &sube; A
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Note that under this definition, A is a subset of
                        itself. We also can define <em>proper</em> subsets of A:
                        these contain only members of A but not <em>all</em> members
                        of A. Both R and O are also proper subsets of A. Our
                        notation is:
                        <br>
                        R &sub; A
                        <br>
                        O &sub; A
                        <br>

                        <li>The empty set: &empty;
                            <br>This set has no members. It is a subset of
                            every other set.
                        <li>The set of all natural numbers: &#8469;
                        <li>The set of all integers: &#8484;
                        <li>The set of all rational numbers: &#8474;

                    <p>
                        We say two sets are equal if they contain the same
                        members. So, if A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {3, 2, 1}, then
                        we can write A = B. (Order does not matter!)

                    <p>
                        The union operator combines two sets so that the new
                        set contains all of the elements of each of the two.

                        If today's baseball game is the Angels versus the
                        Yankees, then the "set of all players" (P) is the union of
                        the "set of all Angels players" (A) and the "set of all
                        Yankees players" (Y).
                        <br>
                        Our notation here is:
                        <br>
                        P = A &cup; Y

                </h3>
                    <p>
                        The intersection of two sets contains only the elements
                        that are in <em>both</em> sets. So if R = {the states
                        that have voted for a Republican candidate for
                        president since 2000} and D = {the states
                        that have voted for a Democratic candidate for 
                        president since 2000} then their intersection is the
                        states that are not pure red or pure blue in this map:
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        This would be the set of swing states, S.
                        <br>
                        Our notation here is:

                    <p>
                    We can define the <em>universe</em> of some group of sets
                    as the collection of all possible members. So if we were
                    surveying American voters, then U = {all American voters}.

                    <br>
                    Or if we are considering American states, then U = {all
                    American states}.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Then, if O = Obama states, and R = Romney states, those
                    sets are <em>complements</em>. We have:
                    <br>
                    O &cup; R = U
                    <br>
                    O &cap; R = &empty;

                These diagrams are a great way to get a picture of the ideas of
