            Here we are dealing with the <i>mean of a sample</i>,
            whereas in looking at <i>z</i> scores we finding the place of a
            single score in a distribution.

            <p>
                <b>Two-tailed versus one-tailed tests</b>:
                <br />
                In a two-tailed test, we are asking is the result unlikely
                in <i>either</i> direction. So if we set &alpha; = .05,
                we are asking is it in the 2.5% area of <i>either</i> tail.
                <br />
                If we are doing a one-tailed test, we want to know if
                the result is in the 5% tail on the side that interests
                us.
                <br />
                So we could ask, "Is the result of using this drug
                significant at &alpha; = .05 in a two-tailed test?"
                <br />
                This means "Did the drug produce results either
                <i>so good</i> <b>or</b> <i>so bad</i> that we should
                expect this result less than 5% of the time by chance?
                <br />
                <b>Or</b> we could ask, "Is the result of using this drug
                significant at &alpha; = .05 in a one-tailed test?"
                <br />
                If our tail is the positive one, we are asking,
                "Should we expect a result this <i>good</i>
                less than 5% of the time by chance?"
                <br />
                And the opposite for the negative tail!
                <br />
                <b>The difference</b>: in a two-tailed test, we are
                asking, "Did this drug have <i>any</i> extreme impact,
                either good or bad?"
                <br />
                In a one-tailed test, we are asking, "Did the drug have
                a very good (or bad) impact?"
            </p>

            <p>
            The equation for the standard deviation of the sample means is:
            </p>

            </figure>

            <p>
                What does this signify? We need to know the SD of the
                population as a whole. Once we know that, we know that 
                the SD of the sample means will come closer and closer
                to the population mean, in proportion to the square root
                of the number of items in the sample we take.
                <br />
                The square root bit explains why it is often
                not economical to increase the sample size beyond 
                a certain amount to achieve a lower &&sigma;;<sub>M</sub>:
                while increasing the sample size by four times will likely
                increase the cost of the sampling by four times, it will
                only decrease the SD of the sample mean by two times.
